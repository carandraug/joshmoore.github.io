I focus on the standardization and storage of bioimaging data. Typically, that means finding ways
of storing large binary with well-specific metadata in order to make them shareable, like this:

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 500px" name="vizarr" src="https://hms-dbmi.github.io/vizarr/v0.1/?source=https://uk1s3.embassy.ebi.ac.uk/idr/zarr/v0.1/9836831.zarr">
</iframe>

You can find more such samples of data from the Image Data Resource at https://idr.github.io/ome-ngff-samples/.
